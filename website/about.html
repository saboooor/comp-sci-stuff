        <h2>The pizza's structure</h2>
        <p>
          Pizza is made with a base of dough, then it is topped with a sauce and some cheese.
          Sometimes, it is also topped with other ingredients.

          The ingredients usually are:
          - Pepperoni
          - Veggies
          - Meat
          - Etc.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The pizza's shape</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the time, the pizza is made with a round base.
          Sometimes, it is made with a rectangular base.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>How it's made</h2>
        <p>
          1. The dough is flattened out into a round or rectangular base, thin or thick
          2. The sauce is added on top of the dough along with the cheese
          2.5. Optionally, other ingredients can also be added on top of the pizza
          3. The pizza is then baked for a certain amount of time
          4. The pizza is then cut into slices
          5. The pizza is then served
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>My personal opinion</h2>
        <p>
          I think that pizza should not have too little sauce in it, because then it is dry
          I also think that pizza should also be served with garlic sauce
